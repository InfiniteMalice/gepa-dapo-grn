# Agent standards

These instructions apply to the entire repository.

## Expectations

- Keep Python lines to 100 characters or fewer.
- Run `ruff check --fix .` and `black .` after making Python changes.
- Prefer explicit, well-typed functions and modules with clear responsibilities.
- Keep imports ordered: standard library, third-party, then local imports.
- Add or update tests for behavior changes when practical.
